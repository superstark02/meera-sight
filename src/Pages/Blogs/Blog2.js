                    What is Cataract?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Cataract is the <b> clouding of the eye's natural lens.</b> It is the most common cause of
                    vision loss in people over age 40 and is also the principal cause of blindness in the world.

                <p>
                    At first, a cataract has little effect on your vision. You may notice that
                    your vision is <b> hazy or blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of
                    glass or a waterfall.</b> Other important clues are:
                    <li>
                        Light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or <b> glaring.</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Difficulty in night driving,</b> the oncoming headlights cause more glare than before.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Decrease in brightness of colours.</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Floaters or <b> Black spots</b> in front of eye
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coloured halo around bright light.

                        Temporary improvement in your near vision, called "second sight."

                <h3>
                    What causes cataracts?
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light
                    onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye's focus, letting us see things
                    clearly both up close and far away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a
                    precise way that keeps the lens clear and letâ€™s light pass through it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>But as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small
                    area of the lens. This is a cataract,</b> and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more
                    of the lens, making it harder to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides <b>advancing age,</b> cataract risk factors include:
                    <li>
                        <b>Ultraviolet radiation</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Diabetes and Hypertension</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Obesity</b>

                <h3>
                    Cataract Prevention
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Studies have shown antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin E, vitamin C, carotenoids
                    lutein and zeaxanthin and foods containing omega-3 fatty acids may reduce cataract risk.
                    Good food sources of vitamin E include sunflower seeds, almonds and spinach. Good sources of
                    lutein and zeaxanthin include spinach, kale and other green, leafy vegetables.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another step you can take to reduce your risk of cataracts is to wear protective sunglasses
                    that block 100 percent of the sun's UV rays when you are outdoors.
                </p>

                    Advanced Cataract surgery also known as Phacoemulsification/MICS is a simple,
                    relatively painless procedure to regain vision. During surgery, we will remove your
                    clouded lens through a very small cut (1.2mm-2.8mm) and in most cases replace it with a clear,
                    plastic intraocular lens (IOL).
