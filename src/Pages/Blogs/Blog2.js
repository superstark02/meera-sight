                    What is Cataract?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Cataract is the clouding of the eye's natural lens. It is the most common cause of
                    vision loss in people over age 40 and is also the principal cause of blindness in the world.

                    Cataract symptoms and signs
                </h3>

                <p>
                    At first, a cataract has little effect on your vision. You may notice that
                    your vision is hazy or blurred a little, like looking through a cloudy piece of
                    glass or a waterfall. Other important clues are:
                    <li>
                        Light from the sun or a lamp may seem too bright or glaring.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Difficulty in night driving, the oncoming headlights cause more glare than before.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Decrease in brightness of colours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Floaters or Black spots in front of eye
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coloured halo around bright light.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Temporary improvement in your near vision, called "second sight."
                    </li>
                </p>

                <h3>
                    What causes cataracts?
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light
                    onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye's focus, letting us see things
                    clearly both up close and far away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a
                    precise way that keeps the lens clear and letâ€™s light pass through it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small
                    area of the lens. This is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more
                    of the lens, making it harder to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides advancing age, cataract risk factors include:
                    <li>
                        Ultraviolet radiation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Diabetes and Hypertension
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Obesity
                    </li>

                        Smoking

                <h3>
                    Cataract Prevention
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Studies have shown antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin E, vitamin C, carotenoids
                    lutein and zeaxanthin and foods containing omega-3 fatty acids may reduce cataract risk.
                    Good food sources of vitamin E include sunflower seeds, almonds and spinach. Good sources of
                    lutein and zeaxanthin include spinach, kale and other green, leafy vegetables.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another step you can take to reduce your risk of cataracts is to wear protective sunglasses
                    that block 100 percent of the sun's UV rays when you are outdoors.
                </p>

                    Advanced Cataract surgery also known as Phacoemulsification/MICS is a simple,
                    relatively painless procedure to regain vision. During surgery, we will remove your
                    clouded lens through a very small cut (1.2mm-2.8mm) and in most cases replace it with a clear,
                    plastic intraocular lens (IOL).

                        Advanced IOLs are being developed to make the surgery less complicated and more helpful to
                        patients. Different types of IOL are:
