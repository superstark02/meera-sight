                    Poor vision isn’t the only indicator of eye disease. In fact, it’s usually the last
                    thing that happens. And, once you start to lose vision, you often can’t get it back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why it is so important to visit your eye doctor regularly. A comprehensive
                    eye exam allows doctors to see things you can’t—so little problems don’t become big ones
                    later on. And, if you’re a contact lens wearer, annual exams are mandatory.

                    Here’s what you need to know about eye exams:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who— Everyone needs regular eye exams, regardless of vision correction needs and overall wellness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What—A comprehensive eye exam may take up to about an hour to an hour and a half and includes a
                    wide array of tests, including refraction, binocular vision testing, color vision testing, dilation
                    with thorough retina assessment, a glaucoma check, slit lamp observation, visual fields assessment,
                    and more. If you wear contact lenses, a contact lens workup is also needed and usually includes
                    additional tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why— Many eye diseases have no symptoms in the early stages, but prompt detection, diagnosis
                    and treatment are important because it can often reduce your risk of permanent vision loss. And,
                    the benefits don’t end there. An eye exam can also sometimes detect systemic conditions, saving more
                    than just your sight! For children, eye exams are especially important. In fact, the American
                    Optometric Association says eye and vision care ought to be given the same level of importance
                    and attention as other standard medical practices, such as dental care and vaccinations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When— Adults with no risk factors or family history of eye problems should get an eye exam at
                    least every two years and annually after age 60.2 Kids need a check-up at 6 months, 3 years,
                    before 1st grade, and then annually after that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where— Many schools and workplaces offer free vision screenings, which is very different than
                    a comprehensive eye exam designed to catch a wide array of diseases.1 Establish a relationship
                    with an eye doctor as soon as possible. If you don’t already have one, use our Find An Eye doctor
