                        The process of vision begins when light rays that reflect off objects
                        and travel through the eye's optical system are refracted and focused
                        into a point of sharp focus on the retina.

                    Refractive Errors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refractive errors are optical imperfections that prevent the eye from properly
                    focusing light, causing blurred vision which can be for distance vision, near
                    vision or reading or both. If this happens in early age it can lead to crossing of
                    eyes or squint in children and may cause permanent damage to vision.

                <h4>
                    How to detect refractive error?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A refractive error can be diagnosed by us during a routine eye examination.
                    Testing usually consists of asking you to read a vision chart while testing an
                    assortment of lenses to maximize your vision. This process can be augmented with
                    help of an auto refractor. Special imaging or other testing is rarely necessary.

                        Want to decrease your dependence on glasses or contact lenses;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Are free of eye disease;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accept the inherent risks and potential side effects of the procedure;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Understand that you could still need glasses or contacts after the procedure to achieve your best vision;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have an appropriate refractive error.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    There is no universally-accepted, best method for correcting refractive errors. 
                    The best option for you should be decided after a thorough examination and discussion 
                    about your lifestyle and your vision needs.
