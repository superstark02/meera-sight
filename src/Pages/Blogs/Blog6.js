                    3-D movies have come a long way since the days of 1950’s classics like the House
                    of Wax and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. With blockbuster 3-D movies like Avatar
                    breaking records and the popularity of 3-D gaming, TV networks and TV sets on the rise,
                    it seems that three-dimensional viewing is here to stay, but is it good for your or your children’s eyes?

                        You may have read the warnings on your 3-D game or TV, “Warning: Children
                        and teenagers may be more susceptible to health issues associated with viewing
                        in 3D…etc.” However, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, there are
                        currently no conclusive studies on the short- and/or long-term effects of 3-D viewing on
                        visual development or eye health in children.

                    <div>
                        However, even though there is no current evidence of long-term effects, some
                        people experience discomfort when watching stereoscopic images. The process of
                        the eyes converging to see images in front of or beyond the screen can create
                        eyestrain and headaches. Sitting at a greater distance from the screen can help
                        alleviate this problem. Viewers with visual motion hypersensitivity (VHM), which
                        can cause motion sickness and vergence-accommodation confilict, may experience dizziness
                        and nausea from 3-D viewing. Those with amblyopia (an imbalance in visual strength between
                        both eyes) or strabismus (misalighned eyes) may have difficulty seeing 3-D images. There is
                        also a small population of people who lack binocular vision and therefore can’t see 3-D
                        images at all.

                        This potential of discomfort has an upside as the ability to perceive depth in 3-D can
                        be a highly sensitive test of a range of vision health indicators. For the 1 in 4 children
                        suffering from underlying vision issues and the 3 to 9 million people with binocular vision
                        problems, viewing 3-D TV and movies can help identify problems and thereby lead to treatments.

                    <div>
                        In addition to the benefit of exposing underlying vision issues, 3-D viewing
                        can have educational benefits as well. For instance, studies have shown teaching in 3-D
                        can result in significant improvement in comprehension and retention over traditional
                        presentations. To learn more about 3D in the classroom, read this public health report by
                        the American Optometric Association (AOA) on the subject.

                    If you or your child experience any issues with 3-D viewing, be sure to 
                    make an appointment for a comprehensive eye exam with your eye care professional. 
                    Turns out that 3-D blockbuster you just saw may lead to improving your vision and eye health!
