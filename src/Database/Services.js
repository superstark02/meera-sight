However, they can also be too big, too small, too weak, or too strong; adding more problems or even injuries to your eyes .Being fit with contact lenses is not a onetime purchase by you, but an on-going commitment from us.</p>
            <p class="font_8">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="font_8">We at&nbsp;MeeraSight&nbsp;perform a comprehensive eye examination and then do an additional contact lens fitting to determine the appropriate lens for each individual&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp;Each brand of contact lenses are made from different materials and depending on the lens parameters fits differently from eye to eye. &nbsp;A proper fit depends on each patient&rsquo;s refractive power, corneal steepness, amount of astigmatism, and many other factors. &nbsp;Only after wearing your lenses for several weeks can we are certain we have achieved the best fit for your eyes, so your follow-up visits are very important. &nbsp;</p>

            <p class="font_8">We fit and prescribe contact lenses to correct a number of vision problems, including nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. The use of contact lenses is not only limited to refractive errors. Specialized contact lenses are used to improve your vision and to treat many eye diseases. Some of these specialized contact lenses available with us are:</p>

However, they can also be too big, too small, too weak, or too strong; adding more problems or even injuries to your eyes .Being fit with contact lenses is not a onetime purchase by you, but an on-going commitment from us.</p>

Along with the sclera (the white of your eye), it serves as a barrier against dirt, germs, and other things that can cause damage. It also plays a key role in vision. As light enters your eye, it gets refracted, or bent, by the cornea&rsquo;s curved edge. This helps determine how well your eye can focus on objects close-up and far away.</span></p>

AMD is a chronic condition that causes the macula, the portion of the retina responsible for seeing fine detail, to become damaged. Symptoms of AMD include blurriness, wavy lines or a blind spot. There are two forms of AMD: dry and wet. Dry AMD usually develops slowly over time, whereas Wet AMD is more serious. Early detection and treatment for either form is very important and is the only way to avoid vision loss.&nbsp;</p>

It occurs when blood vessels in the retina change and become damaged or new abnormal blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina. People with diabetic retinopathy usually do not notice changes in their vision until the disease progresses. It is very important for people with diabetic retinopathy to see an ophthalmologist every year. If left untreated, the disease can cause irreparable vision loss.<br />&nbsp;</p>

This means that you are at increased risk of Retinal tears and retinal holes. These tears or holes of left untreated may lead to retinal detachment and sudden loss of vision.</p>
