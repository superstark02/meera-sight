            <p class="font_8">Contact lenses, if you need them, can make everyday tasks possible. Because they are invisible, they are a popular alternative to glasses. However, they can also be too big, too small, too weak, or too strong; adding more problems or even injuries to your eyes .Being fit with contact lenses is not a onetime purchase by you, but an on-going commitment from us.</p>
            <p class="font_8">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="font_8">We at&nbsp;MeeraSight&nbsp;perform a comprehensive eye examination and then do an additional contact lens fitting to determine the appropriate lens for each individual&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp;Each brand of contact lenses are made from different materials and depending on the lens parameters fits differently from eye to eye. &nbsp;A proper fit depends on each patient&rsquo;s refractive power, corneal steepness, amount of astigmatism, and many other factors. &nbsp;Only after wearing your lenses for several weeks can we are certain we have achieved the best fit for your eyes, so your follow-up visits are very important. &nbsp;</p>

            <p class="font_8">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="font_8">Contact lenses are medical devices worn on the eye that can potentially cause serious eye health complications. &nbsp;Some of these more serious complications may lead to permanent loss of vision. &nbsp;This is why it is extremely important that contact lens wearers have evaluations at least every year.</p>
            <p class="font_8"><br />Frequently the difference between&nbsp;success&nbsp;and&nbsp;failure&nbsp;for a contact lens patient is the care received&nbsp;after&nbsp;the lenses are fit.&nbsp;</p>
